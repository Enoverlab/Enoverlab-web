        content1: "If you are just starting out in product management, one of the most important questions you would be finding answers to is how much do product managers earn in Nigeria. So in this article, I would be giving you answers based on years of experience and data from speaking with different product managers.",
        content2: "Here it is;",
        content3: "An entry-level Product Manager with less than one year working experience will earn between N100,000 - N200,000 monthly.",
        content4: "A mid-level Product Manager with 1 - 4 years working experience will earn between N200,000 - N500,000 monthly.",
        content5: "A senior-level Product Manager with 5 years working experience and above will earn N500,000 and above monthly",
        content6: "This is the average salary range for the product manager role in Nigeria. The salary excludes other benefits that might come with the role like work laptop, internet data, HMO, paid leave, stock options, equity etc.",
        content7:"The exact amount you would earn as a product manager is relative to your skills, your experience level including non PM experience, the previous products you’ve been involved in building, the results you’ve achieved including non PM related results, your ability to sell your value to the hiring company, the company, the stage the company is at, how well funded the company is and a host of other factors. Also, it is important to note that the salary range is not limited to the figures shared above as some product managers earn way much more despite their experience - there are product managers with less than 1 year experience earning more than N200,000, PMs with 2 - 4 years experience earning well over N400,000 and those with 5 years and above earning above N800,000 monthly.",
        content8: "However, the average salary range are the first figures I shared earlier.",
        content9: "Note: These figures don't apply to companies based outside Nigeria.",
        content10:"Now you know how much a Product Manager earns and can potentially earn as you grow in the career path. I hope this helps you to make a good decision on the next phase of your career.",

        content1:"Many times, when people are starting out in product management they neglect their overall work experience because they think it's not important in product management. However, this is not true, and it's not the best way to start your PM career on a strong foot.",
        content2:"Product management is a dynamic field that does not necessarily need a specific technical knowledge for you to thrive. It is a field that you can come into with all the skills you’ve gathered from your previous work experience and then learn the core PM skills along the way.For example, if you have worked in a bank for 4 years and you are now considering coming into product management, then you have skills that you would have developed in the bank like working with a team, completing projects in specific timelines, collaborating with people, writing reports, talking to customers, resolving issues etc. All these skills are important transferable skills that you can use as a product manager. Even though they are not all core PM skills, they will come in very handy for you to do your job as a product manager effectively over time.",
        content3:"So don’t put yourself under too much pressure while transitioning into product management, your prior experiences (even the non-professional ones like working with a team in church, mosque or association) can be very much useful and handy in helping you become a great product manager as you understand how to interpret and utilize it effectively in the product management space.",

        content6:"Working in the product manager role gives you the opportunity to practically build high level leadership skills without having to go to a high end leadership training program or school. This is because product managers are placed with the responsibility of building products without being given direct authority to lead the team. PM’s have to rely on soft influence, communication and people management skills to lead the development and delivery of products. The leadership skills you will build as a PM can be valuable in any field outside tech.",
        content7:"By coming into product management, you get to transition into tech without having to be technically driven or understand the technicalities of building tech products. A lot of times, people who don’t have flair for writing codes can easily come into tech via the product management route. Now this doesn’t mean that product management is easier than coding - coding is a lot more technical; however, it doesn’t necessarily require coding skills except if you want to be a Technical Product Manager.",

If you are a chronic overthinker, this will affect your workflow thereby affecting your ability to work in an agile approach to get things done. In today's competitive world, the slower you deliver, the more detrimental it can be to the business both in the short and long term",
        content6:"Making assumptions is one habit to avoid. Never assume you understand someone or something, always ask questions. Inexperienced PMs are guilty of this. Asking questions doesn't mean you are unprofessional or you talk too much - NO! Asking questions makes you understand the other party better; it helps you understand your users, your colleagues and your team a lot better. The more questions you ask, the more clarification you get; this will affect your overall performance as a PM.  If you’re just transitioning into the product management world, take note of these habits and try to be mindful of them as you get into the career path.",

People management and emotional intelligence skills are one of the skills that can help a product manager be more effective in their duties.For example, software developers/engineers are one of the most interesting people to work with. If you are a new product manager, you might have a lot of back and forth with your developers/engineering team. The better you get working with your dev team is a big sign that you are growing as a product manager; the better you get working with your team is a strong sign you are growing.",
